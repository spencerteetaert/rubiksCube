# rubiksCube
This virtual Rubik's cube is a project I made in my senior year of highschool using the Graphics3D framework I had developed. It has
the same functionality of a Rubik's cube in real life with the exception that the virtual one is unbreakable and you can't paint over
the colours. 

You can however turn each side clockwise and counterclockwise, scramble the cube, and solve the cube. There's also a help menu for a list
of controls.
